NOTES:

You can add as many quizzes as you want as long as you don't have a total number of answers exceeding the limit of the mysql BIGINT data-type.  There is not yet a script to change the default login, but there is planned to be one by the end of the beta period for V1.0.  If you want to change the login manually, you can either add a new user and delete the old row from the admins table, or you can change the information in the mysql database, The hashing algorithm used is MD5.
